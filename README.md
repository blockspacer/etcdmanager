 ## Warning! This repo is deprecated and it won't be updated anymore!
 
 The project is still very much alive, but it's now sponsored by [I-Cell Mobilsoft](https://icellmobilsoft.hu/en), so the code has been moved. Please update your bookmarks and use the following URL from now on:
 
 [https://github.com/icellmobilsoft/etcdmanager](https://github.com/icellmobilsoft/etcdmanager).
 
 ## 1.0 is out now!
 
 Our first production release has just arrived. Head over to the new [repo](https://github.com/icellmobilsoft/etcdmanager/releases) and grab it! :)
